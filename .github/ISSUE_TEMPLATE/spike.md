<!--
  This is a template for creating issues for spikes, research and investigation pieces.
  If you're unsure whether a spike is appropriate, read this guidance on using spikes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17W_d0aYszgh7HTgnTHZLxXDu_TJyu8zzWt_lXH8VaHA/edit#

## What

## Why

## Assumptions

<!-- Any assumptions about this piece of work which may be helpful to document -->

## Timebox

<!-- e.g: 2 days -->

We should review progress after this period of time has elapsed, even [if the spike has not been 'completed'](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17W_d0aYszgh7HTgnTHZLxXDu_TJyu8zzWt_lXH8VaHA/edit#heading=h.jd56itytegn6)

## Who is working on this?

<!-- We have agreed as a team to trial a process where each spike has a 'lead' and a 'buddy'. It is up to the lead and buddy to agree how much involvement the buddy has. This may vary depending on what the spike is, ranging from heavily involved (pairing) to less involved (reviewing/bouncing ideas off) -->

## Questions to answer

<!-- Remember, smaller and more defined questions are easier to focus in on -->

- [ ] Questions go here...

## Done when

<!-- Template ‘done when ‘ criteria have automatically been added - add/remove/tweak these as appropriate -->

You may find it helpful to refer to our [expected outcomes of spikes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17W_d0aYszgh7HTgnTHZLxXDu_TJyu8zzWt_lXH8VaHA/edit#heading=h.mmkqzigd11rs).

- [ ] Questions have been answered or we have a clearer idea of how to get to our goal
- [ ] Findings have been reviewed and agreed with at least one other person
- [ ] Findings have been shared, e.g: via a write-up on the ticket, at a show & tell or team meeting
