title: Send your feedback - Verify
scenario: |
  You have used a service called GOV.UK Verify and wish to report an issue.

  Things to try:

  1. Intentionally put too much content in the feedback box.

    “What were you trying to do” question has a limit of 100 characters.

    “Please provide details of your question, problem or feedback” has a limit
    of 300 characters.

  2. Say that you want a reply, but avoid filling in the details of how you
      would like to be contacted.

  3. Avoid answering the question “Do you want a reply?”
