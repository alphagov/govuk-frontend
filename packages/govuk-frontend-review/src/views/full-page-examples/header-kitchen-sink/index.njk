name: Child maintenance (Header kitchen sink)
scenario: |
  Worst case scenario that includes all possible header-related components.

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you already have an active case</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">If you have a case with the same parent you should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/child-maintenance-service/change-of-circumstances" class="govuk-link"> report a change of circumstances </a>instead of making a new arrangement. You can use this service if you want to set up a new arrangement with a different parent.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Fees</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">If you decide to use the Child Maintenance Service the application fee is £20 and cannot be refunded. You’ll need a debit or credit card to pay this. It does not guarantee an arrangement.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body-m">You will not have to pay the application fee if you:</p>
