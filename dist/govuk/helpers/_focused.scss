  // Fixes an issue in Chromium 108–111 where the box-shadow on the focus state
  // is missing on links that wrap across multiple lines [1].
  //
  // However, text-wrap: balance doesn't play nicely with box-decoration-break:
  // clone, causing links to re-flow when focused [2]. As text-wrap: balance
  // wasn't introduced until Chromium 114 we can use it as a way to target
  // this fix to just 108–111.
