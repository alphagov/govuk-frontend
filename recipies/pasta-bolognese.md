# Pasta Bolognese

## Ingredients

- Olive oil
- Beef mince
- Pork mince
- Pancetta lardons
- Onion, chopped
- Carrot, chopped
- Celery, chopped
- Tomato paste/puree
- Chicken or vegetable stock
- Milk
- Bay leaves
- Parmesan rinds
- Pasta, ideally fettuccine or rigatoni
- Black pepper and grated parmesan to finish

## Method

1. Heat olive oil in a large, high walled pan
2. Add the pancetta and cook until some of the fat starts to render out
3. Add the minces and cook until browned
4. Add onion, carrot and celery and cook until sweated down
5. Add tomato paste or puree and cook just until cooked
6. Add stock to cover, along with milk, bay leaves and parmesan rinds, cover pan and cook sauce for 3-4 hours or until significantly reduced
7. Uncover the bolognese, skimming off any excess pools of fat and tasting for seasoning
8. Cook your pasta in a separate pan of salted boiling water. Remove pasta just before done and reserve the cooking water
9. In a separate pan over medium low heat, transfer all or a portion of the bolognese, the pasta and a portion of the pasta water. Finish cooking the pasta in the bolognese and pasta water. If the sauce evaporates too much, add more pasta water, little by little
10. Serve with some black pepper and a sprinkle of grated parmesan
