## Polyfilling

> [!NOTE]  
> This doc has been removed.

This doc previously demonstrated how to add an `addEventListener` polyfill using polyfill.io. Unfortunately polyfill.io was reported as compromised on 25th June 2024 so we are no longer recommending it as a polyfilling service. We cannot advise on producing polyfills at the moment and appologise for the inconvenience.

If you've used this doc to produce a polyfill using polyfill.io in the past we strongly recommend checking your produced polyfill(s) for malicious code.

GOV.UK Frontend v4.8.0 and below makes reference to polyfill.io and uses polyfills generated by polyfill.io, however they were generated before polyfill.io came under malicious ownership and don't contain any malicious code.
