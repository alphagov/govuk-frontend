# Before you publish a pre-release of GOV.UK Frontend

Decide the kind of pre-release you're publishing. All pre-releases are public, but we distinguish between:

- `internal` pre-releases for internal use
- `beta` pre-releases aimed at external users

We'll use the kind of pre-release as [the pre-release identifier](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-version#preid) in the package version.

## If you're publishing a beta pre-release

Besides publishing the code itself, beta releases will likely involve code-related documentation updates and user communications, much like an actual release.

Review the docs for [what to do before publishing a release](/docs/releasing/before-publishing-a-release.md) to assess which steps you need to follow for your specific pre-release and ensure you are prepared to publish.

See the [documentation on support branches](https://team-playbook.design-system.service.gov.uk/how-we-work/version-control/support-branches.html#support-branches) if you need to publish a new pre-release of previous major versions of GOV.UK Frontend.

# Publish a new version of GOV.UK Frontend

Developers should pair on pre-releases. When working remotely, it can be useful to be on a call together.

1. Check out the **main** branch and pull the latest changes.

2. Ensure you're running the version of NodeJS matching [`.nvmrc`](/.nvmrc).
   - If you use NVM, run `nvm use` to set up the right version
   - If you use another management system (like [`asdf`](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)), compare the output of `node --version` and install the right one if necessary

3. Run `npm ci` to make sure you have the exact dependencies installed.

4. Determine the `< PRE_RELEASE_IDENTIFIER >`
   - Use `internal` for internal pre-releases
   - Use `beta` for beta pre-releases

5. Determine the `< PRE_RELEASE_VERSION_TYPE >`

   As examples with a `beta` pre-release identifier:
   - Use `premajor` to bump from `v4.7.0` to `v5.0.0-beta.0`
   - Use `preminor` to bump from `v4.7.0` to `v4.8.0-beta.0`
   - Use `prepatch` to bump from `v4.7.0` to `v4.7.1-beta.0`

   See the [versioning documentation](/docs/contributing/versioning.md) for more information.

   Alternatively, when publishing an update to an existing pre-release:
   - Use `prerelease` to bump from `v5.0.0-beta.0` to `v5.0.0-beta.1`
   - Use `prerelease` to move from `v5.0.0-internal.X` to `v5.0.0-beta.0`.
     Note that this resets the final number to `.0`, so prefer setting the version manually if a pre-release of the kind you're running has already gone through.

6. Apply the new pre-release version number by running:

   ```shell
   npm version < PRE_RELEASE_VERSION_TYPE > --preid < PRE_RELEASE_IDENTIFIER > --no-git-tag-version --workspace govuk-frontend
   ```

   This step will update [`govuk-frontend`'s `package.json`](/packages/govuk-frontend/package.json) and project [`package-lock.json`](/package-lock.json) files.

   Do not commit the changes.

7. Create and check out a new branch (`release-[version]`)

   ```shell
   git switch -c "release-$(npm run version --silent --workspace govuk-frontend)"
   ```

8. If you're publishing a beta pre-release, update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md) by:
   - changing the 'Unreleased' heading to the new version number and release type. For example, '5.0.0-beta.0 (Pre-release)'
   - adding a new 'Unreleased' heading above the new version number and release type, so users will know where to add PRs to the changelog
   - saving your changes

9. Run `npm run build-release` to:
   - build GOV.UK Frontend into [the package's `/dist`](/packages/govuk-frontend/dist) and [root `/dist`](/dist) directories
   - commit the changes
   - push a branch to GitHub

   You will now be prompted to continue or cancel. Check the details and enter `y` to continue. If something does not look right, press `N` to cancel the build and creation of the branch on GitHub.

10. Create a pull request.
    When reviewing the PR, check that the version numbers have been updated and that the compiled assets use this version number.

11. Once a reviewer approves the pull request, merge it to **main**.

## Publish a release to npm

1. Check out the **main** branch and pull the latest changes.

   If there was an interruption between the raising of the PR and its merge,
   or it's another developer running the publication to npm, rebuild the package with:

   ```shell
   npm run build:package
   ```

2. Sign in to npm (`npm login`), using the credentials for the govuk-patterns-and-tools npm user from Bitwarden.

3. Run `npm run publish-prerelease`, which will prompt you to enter an NPM tag. Set the npm tag corresponding to the kind of release you're publishing:
   - `internal` for internal pre-releases
   - `next` for beta pre-releases

4. You will now be prompted to continue or cancel the release. Check the details and enter `y` to continue. If something does not look right, press `N` to cancel the release.

   This step will create a ZIP file containing the release in the root of your govuk-frontend git directory. You will need this file when creating the GitHub release.

   This step will also automatically create a tag in GitHub which you can use to create a GitHub release in the following section.

5. Verify the presence of the pre-release and its tag on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-frontend?activeTab=versions)

   If the pre-release has been assigned the wrong tag (mistakes happen),
   you can use [`npm dist-tag`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag) to quickly correct.

6. Have a quick look at the diff of the new package with the previous one at:

   ```txt
   https://diff.intrinsic.com/govuk-frontend/<PREVIOUS_VERSION_NUMBER>/<RELEASED_VERSION_NUMBER>
   ```

7. Run `npm logout` to log out from npm. If you've logged in through your browser, remember to log out from <https://npmjs.com> there as well.

## If publishing a beta pre-release, create a release on GitHub

To create a new GitHub release, do the following:

1. Select the tag corresponding to the release in [the list of tags on GitHub](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tags)
2. Press **Create release from tag**
3. Set 'GOV.UK Frontend v[version]' as the title
4. Add release notes from [`CHANGELOG.md`](/CHANGELOG.md)
5. Attach as release binary the ZIP file that has been generated at the root of this project during the npm publishing phase
6. [Select "This is a pre-release"](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) to mark the release as a pre-release
7. Publish release

# After you publish the new pre-release

If you're publishing a beta pre-release, read the docs for [what to do after publishing a release](/docs/releasing/after-publishing-a-release.md) and assess which parts may be relevant to your pre-release.
