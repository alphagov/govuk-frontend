=====================

GOV.UK Frontend contains the code you need to start building a user interface
for government platforms and services.

See live examples of GOV.UK Frontend components, and guidance on when to use
them in your service, in the [GOV.UK Design
System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

## Contact the team

GOV.UK Frontend is maintained by a team at Government Digital Service. If you want to know more about GOV.UK Frontend, please email the [Design System
team](mailto:govuk-design-system-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) or get in touch with them on [Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/govuk-design-system).

## Quick start

There are 2 ways to start using GOV.UK Frontend in your app:

- [using Node.js package manager
  (npm)](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/installing-with-npm/) (recommended)
- by [copying our CSS, JavaScript and asset
  files into your project](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/install-using-precompiled-files/)

Once installed, you will be able to use the code from the examples in the
[GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
in your service.

You should also have a plan to [stay up to date with changes](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/staying-up-to-date/).

## Browser and assistive technology support

To help manage the ever-growing number of browser versions, we group browsers into 4 grades:

- **grade A** - Most recent stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Samsung Internet and Safari
- **grade B** - All stable versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge released in the last 6 months and the last 4 major stable releases of Safari which are not supported in Grade A
- **grade C** - [All browsers that support `<script type="module">`](https://caniuse.com/es6-module) (Chrome 61+, Edge 16-18, Edge 79+, Firefox 60+, Safari 11+)
- **grade X** - All other browsers (including IE11 and older)

> **Note: Only browsers in grades A, B and C will run our JavaScript enhancements. We will not support our JavaScript enhancements for older browsers in grade X.**

For more information see [our Browser Support documentation](/docs/contributing/browser-support.md).

GOV.UK Frontend also supports:

- [recommended assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies#which-assistive-technologies-to-test-with)
- your users overriding colours in Windows, Firefox and Chrome

## Accessibility

The GOV.UK Design System team works hard to ensure that GOV.UK Frontend is accessible.

Using Frontend will help your service meet [level AA of WCAG 2.2](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag). But you must still [check that your service meets accessibility requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction), especially if you extend or modify components.

You should also use [the JavaScript from GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#javascript) and read the [accessibility statement for the GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/).
